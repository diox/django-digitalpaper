Django Digitalpaper is a newspaper viewer in Django, JavaScript, CSS and HTML5.

It needs a better README to explain how it works, what you need to get it to
run, etc. The few things you should know:

- Its goal is to emulate the look & feel of a newspaper on the web.
- It can run without django. Replace the views and template, there is very 
  little django code at the moment.
- It should be compatible with all modern browsers, and some older ones (IE7).
- It was initially developped by and for Liberation.fr , and you can find it in
  production at http://journal.liberation.fr/publication/liberation/
